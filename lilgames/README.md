These are small little command line games in Python that I did relatively indepedently I'm proud of them :). Consists of rock paper scissors, tic tac toe, and hangman.

7/23/21 Update. Added commandline blackjack. There's no split or insurance options. It's my first project with object oriented programming :). I feel like this project helped get more of a solid grasp on OOP. Written in Python 3.8.10 and has keyboard 0.13.5 as it's only dependency.
